The lashes came at him unexpectedly, striking at a farily consistent rhythimic beats at him, almost synchronizing with the sound of the raindrops gently tapping the roof tiles. His loud scream accompanied by the occassional thunderstorm and the constant water droplet sound formed a heart-wrenching sonata rivaled by Beethoven himself.

His mom's pumping red eyes with a glint of sorrow, drizzles of saliva flying around as she ferociously instructing him to go back to his room. Obediently, the boy slowly got up from his usual corner, carrying his badly bruised body over to his room, an act he was gotten used to these days. 

The rain finally stopped. 

"You luk sad today, wat happin to you?", the boy said to sheriff woody sitting at his bedside table, now turning to meet the boy glance, as he gently turn the figure around. "Why are you always makin that face to me?" He picked him up, a sprinkle of tear droplets partially covered Sheriff's perfect white teeth. He hold woody close to his chest, as though as to assure woody everything is all right.

"Hey! I kno wat shud I do!" The boy proclaimed suddenly, while wiping away his tears on the corner of his sleeve. "You and I are goin to find out why! Promise me that you'll help me Sheriff!" Sheriff stared at him with a blank expression, which he gladly took it as a yes. "Tank you so much Sheriff!"

He steady himself, closed his eyes, and breathed 3 deep breaths -- a trick that his father taught him whenever he felt his anxiety is growing. He slowly tip-toeing to his mom's room and sat, back at the wall, eavesdropping. He can briefly make out that his mom is crying. He waited patiently, just as the sun waited patiently for the rain to stop, and emerge again gracefully, he wonder to himself. After the voice of his mother crying died down, he slowly open the door,
creeping into the room.

The view was plain horrible, pile of clothes scatterred around the room, furniture being smashed into broken pieces, photo frame shattered across the table. His mom laid soundlessly on the bed, with smudged eye shades and trails of finger scratches visible across the face, she appeared to be sleeping.

"She luk terrible." He whispered into woody's left ear. He slowly approached his mother and scrutinized her once sparkling face, when a glint of reflecting light from a photo frame caught his attention. He picked the frame up, ran his fingers over the frame, feeling the slight grooves that formed over his father's face.

"Father face is ruin," he frowned at the multiple grooves, rendering his father's face unrecognizable. He noticed there was a letter hiding behind the frame. He carefully opened it and read the content. 

"Woody we'll hav to find papa! He'll be able to stop all tis." As soon as he finished, he clutched the letter and the frame, sprinted down the staircase. Woody's head bobbling around, hands flailing as though as calling for help. Perhaps it's the new found purpose of his rather bland life, or perhaps it's the excitement of role-playing detective Gailileo -- his hero, to solve the problem following the clues in the letter. The boy set out of the house with much enthusiasm that a 8 years old
should have, Sheriff Woody followed along.

He stepped on the water puddle that formed after the rain, not a care in the world about the condition of his white shoes, or the furious scolding that he's going to get for his shoes upon his return. This was the first time he walked the busy street, crowd of people passing by him with a fast pace. He did his breathing routine to calm himself, and continue down the busy road.

"Tis must be the ice cream uncle!" He said to Woody and point towards the ice-cream stall five meters away.

The ice-cream uncle is bending down and scooping a handful of vanilla ice-cream, while maintaining his big smile to the little girl standing infront of the stall. The girl flashes a beaming smile at the uncle, and walked away happily towards the waiting parents.

He approaches the ice-cream stall

Thus begin the journey of a boy and a worn out doll to solve the mystery once and for all.
