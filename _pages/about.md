Hello to whoever bother to click the about page. I started out this blog to dump all my thoughts that I gathered when I'm staring at the shampoo bottle in the toilet when dumb me forgot to bring my phone. It's probably not worth your time following the blog, but if you do, it's me that forced you to. That said, this about page is really short, so I'll just dump my all time favourite books.

1. **The travelling cat chronicles by Hiro Aikawa** - If you love cats, prepare some tissue box.
2. **Under the midnight sun by Keigo Higashino** - Detective mystery book that doesn't read like detective mystery book.
3. **Kafka on the shore by Haruki Murakami** - Ridiculously weird magical realism book that will stick with you.
4. **A thousand splendid suns by Khaled Hosseini** - Depicting the struggles of woman in middle east, in a tear jerking way.
5. **The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared by Jonas Jonasson** - One of the funniest book I've read.
6. **A man called Ove by Fredrik Backman** - Ove is my spritual animal.
7. **Brief Answers to the Big Questions by Stephen Hawking** - One of the rare non-fiction that I actually finished.
