There was nothing, initially, apart from the occasional glittering of the firefly, and fine dust brushing by my arms lazily. That was until that night, where she stumbled into my life, opened up the old rusty window and let the sunlight flooded over me gracefully.

I'm lying down with her on her bed, observing her enigmatic face while she recounts me her exciting stories, one with the adventure of taming the unicorn, and one with the brave confrontation with the overlord of the four-legged fox. I was brought over to the mystified rainbow town by her, where not a single tear was dropped, and fairies roaming around gleefully healing everybody that was hurt, and she was the fairest among all.

She will always jump around the room, when she was over the moon. I wanted to give her the greatest hug, and tell her that she deserved it. I want to let her know that I am happy and super proud of her. But instead, I stared expressionlessly at her everytime, unable to convey the emotion deep inside of me. "Thank you." That's all she said to me with her brightest smile before turning away from
me, leaving me in agony.

I hate myself, for not telling her what I always feel. That time when she raged over the movie invites to "The Cat Movie" from someone creepy, I was unable to stand up to fight for her. And that time she got confessed by a boy and eventually accepted it, I'm locked inside my room crying a river. And that time when she got engaged with someone she truly loved, I was unable to give her my sincere blessing. And that time she gave birth to a twin, I was not there to tell her that she
will make a good mother to her kids.

I met her the very last time one day in autumn, where leaves were swaying lazily down the trees to meet the floor. She held my hands passionately, with the eye conveying thousands of words, so mysterious, yet so profound.

"Mommy what are you doing? We need to go!" Her daughter yelled at her.

"Oh you can't wait to move to the new house aren't you. Give me a sec sweetheart, mom needs to handle some final stuff."

She looked at me one last time, her tears began to slowly roll down to her cheeks, as she whispered one last "goodbye" to me. I was picturing the day to come after 20 years of being a doll to her. Perhaps it was a breath of relieve, or the melancholy building up inside of me, or perhaps, it was just thankfulness to everything because it happened, I smiled the first smile of my doll career. 

"Thank you... for everything..." She said, and smiled back to me too. Unable to hold back her tears any longer, she gently put me inside the box, sealed it, and there was nothing again. A strand of her hair fall into my side, reminding me of the very first night where she picked me up on the blind alley with both her hand clutching me tightly, also the night where an angel inserts a soul into a doll.

I want to let her know that she will always be the love of my life, the sunlight that sprouts the growth of happiness within me, illuminating every corner of my rather bland soul with her holy presence.

But what can I do?

> I'm just a fucking doll.
