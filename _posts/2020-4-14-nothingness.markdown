There was nothing, initially, apart from the occasional glittering of the firefly, and fine dust brushing by my arms lazily. That was until that night, where she stumbled into my life, opened up the old rusty window and let the sunlight flooded over me gracefully.

I'm lying down with her on her bed, observing her enigmatic face while she recounts me her exciting stories, one with the adventure of taming the unicorn, and one with the brave confrontation with the overlord of the four-legged fox. I was brought over to the mystified rainbow town by her, where not a single tear was dropped, and fairies roaming around gleefully healing everybody that was hurt, and she was the fairest among all.

She was jumping around the room one day, apparently overjoyed with the news of her being accepted to the college that she always wanted. I felt over the moon at that time, I wanted to give her the biggest hug, I want to tell her that she deserved it, I want to let her know that it's the happiest day of my life and I was proud of her, but instead I stared expressionlessly at her, unable to convey the emotion deep inside of me. "Thank you." That's all she said to me with her brightest smile before turning away from
me.

I hate myself, for not telling her she was the love of my life. That time when she raged over the movie invites to "the Cat movie" from someone creepy, I was unable to stand up to fight for her. And that time she got confessed by a boy and eventually accepted it, I'm locked inside my room crying a river. And that time when she got engaged with someone she truly loved, I was unable to give her my sincere blessing. And that time she gave birth to a twin, I was not there to tell her that she
will make a good mother to her kids.

I met her the very last time one day in autumn, where leaves were swaying lazily down the trees to meet the floor. She held my hands passionately, with the eye conveying thousands of words, so mysterious, yet so profound.

"Mommy what are you doing? We need to go!" Her daughter yelled at her.

"Oh you can't wait to move to the new house aren't you. Give me a sec sweetheart, mom needs to handle some final stuff."

She looked at me one last time, her tears began to slowly roll down to her cheeks, as she whispered one last "goodbye" to me. I was picturing the day to come, after 20 years of being the doll to her, that was enough for me. Perhaps it was a relieve, or the melancholy building up inside of me, or perhaps, it's just thankfulness to everything because it happened, I smiled the first smile of my doll career. She smiled back to me too, unable to hold back her tears any longer, she gently put me inside the box, sealed it, and there was nothing again.

She is the love of my life, the sunlight that sprouts the growth of happiness within me.

But what can I do?

> I'm just a fucking doll.
