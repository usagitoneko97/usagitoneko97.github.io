Technology has come a long way. But most people does not utilize the available technologies, whether or not it's about work or just personal stuff. It really should blame on major OSes like Windows and mac that are targetted to the average users, users that are expecting OSes that 'just works'--also the tagline for Apple. Because of this nature, these propietary OSes won't expose every component to the user and only left out what users wanted to see. Is it easy for non-technological savvy
person to familiarize Windows? Yes. Can you make use of the available functionalities of Windows and perform automation to its full potential? Maybe if you invest all your time.

A lot of times where you need to perform tasks that are not provided by Windows machine, and that forces you to install 3rd party software application that most probably have ads that requires you to pay for getting rid of it, or will offered a paid subscription plan for 'additional features'. In fairness they are propietary software and it's their core business model. Open source software on the other hand would not never have ads, and would always free, as in price and freedom, and unix based os remains the only viable option to fully embrace the open source world.

In unix world, every utilities that you'll ever need are there, and almost all the time privacy paranoia user can inspect the source code itself, making sure every aspect is secure. With the propietary software? You just have to trust them to not do the bad thing.
