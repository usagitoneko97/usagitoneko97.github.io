It was a pleasant morning, glints of sunlight shone brightly at the people of Kampung Megah, preparing them for yet another day of work. Not far from Lim's worn down house, a fruit lorry carried a full load stumble upon the unpaved road, and three unfortunate fruits came rolling out of the box. Lil Lim, the son of lim, gets up abruptly from the veranda to glimpse at what's the exciting treasure can be found this time.

Banana watched as the young boy walked away with a face of disgust, [insert offensive words from banana],
while Orange frantically glanced around the unfamiliar surroundings. 

"Don't panic Orange," said Apple, slowly rolled to the edge of the road. "Listen, you all better starts to move, there's a very high chance you'll turn into orange juice. And banana juice too. Come on now."
"I didn't want to know what's banana orange juice taste like. Come on now"

The three of them slowly head towards a wooden house. "What's going to happen next?" Orange asked nervously. "I don't know, but it seems like god gave us conscious to fulfil our fate, and that is," Apple answered, and glanced towards an old man chewing into a pear nonchalantly. "to be eaten by a human, I guess." 

Banana and Orange stared at Apple silently, slowly registering the cold bitter words from Apple.

"No. That's not what I want to do." Banana replied, with eyes full of determination. "All the process..."

"Are you planning fruits revolution Banana you banana. We are just fruits!"

"Oh yeah... You are right" The dejected banana lowered down his banana tips, and walked towards the boy reluctantly. Apple and Orange followed banana from the back.

"Hey kid." Banana shouting towards the kid sat on the porch. The kid's eye widen at the scene of a talking fruits.
