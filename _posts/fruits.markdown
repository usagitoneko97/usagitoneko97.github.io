It was a pleasant morning, glints of sunlight shone brightly at the people of Kampung Megah, preparing them for yet another day of work. Not far from Lim's worn down house, a fruit lorry carried a full load stumble upon the unpaved road, and three unfortunate fruits came rolling out of the box. Lil Lim, the son of lim, gets up abruptly from the veranda to glimpse at what's the exciting treasure can be found this time.

Banana watched as the young boy walked away with a face of disgust, [insert offensive words from banana],
while Orange frantically glanced around the unfamiliar surroundings. 'Shit shit shit, what am I doing here? Why did I have conscious all of a sudden! We are suppose to rest peacefully, not having any ideas of where we are going, how we are used, what...'

"Don't panic Orange," interjected Apple, slowly rolled to the edge of the road. "Listen, you all better starts to move, there's a very high chance you'll turn into orange juice. And banana juice too. Come on now."

"I didn't want to know what's banana orange juice taste like. Come on now"

The three of them slowly head towards a wooden house. "What's going to happen next?" Orange asked nervously. "I don't know, but it seems like god gave us conscious to fulfil our fate, and that is," Apple answered, and glanced towards an old man chewing into a pear nonchalantly. "to be eaten by a human, I guess." 

Banana and Orange stared at Apple silently, slowly registering the cold bitter words from Apple.

"No. That's not what I want to do." Banana replied. 'All the year that we've suffered, being blasted with sunlight and soaking  with the goddamn rain, all the process..."

"Are you planning fruits revolution Banana? We are just ...fruits."

"Oh yeah... You are right" The dejected banana lowered down his banana tips, and walked towards the boy reluctantly. Apple and Orange followed banana from the back.

"Hey kid." Banana shout towards the kid sat on the porch. The kid's eye widen at the scene of a talking fruits.

'What...' 

'Yeah, you. Can you do us a favour?', Apple asked.

'Oh my... You can speak! ' The kid shrieked at the fruits.

'Yeah kid, listen, we are not bad guys okay?' Apple said. Banana frowned at apple and said, 'Yeah I mean, we are just fruits kiddo how bad can we be? Just imagine it's a toy story, but with fruits.'

'Yeah... I guess.' the kid started to relax at his words, and settle his gaze back at the fruits. 'So, what do y'all want me to do?'

'We want you to eat us', apple blurted it out nonchalantly.

The kid's round chubby face contorted to a shape much horrified as before, and started running in to the house, while shouting for his dear life.

'See, I told you kids nowadays didn't like to eat fruits anymore. All they want is just artificial chocolate with 1kg of sugar.' banana said.

'Uhh, pretty sure is the fact that apple asked him to eat us.' Orange said.

'Anyway, we'll have to probably deal with his dad in a moment, any idea?' apple said.

Just when Orange was going to speak up, the boy silently pushed his dad inside, while muttering something.

'Look John, I know school is though for you. But you have to keep going. Don't make a joke like that. It's sad for your dad you know'.

'No dad what are you saying. There are three fruits trying to talk to me. And they wanted me to eat them!'

'Okay that's enough. If you really hate school that much, fine. Just drop out of the school and work with me to be a goddamn useless farmer for the rest of your life. If that's what you want.' said his dad angrily and stomp his way out.

'Wait, really?'The frightened look on his face has replaced with excitement as he quickly followed his dad.

'Well, the kid's will be dumb either way so it's not exactly our fault right?' Banana said. Right at the moment, Apple could hear a faint waling sound echoed from the living room inside. Three of them shivered at the sound.

'It... souded like someone pleading for help. Should we go and check it out?' Apple said, and lead the rest of them in to the living room. As they were approaching, the cries sounded much horrifying. Nonetheless, they brace themselve and slowly stepped, or rather, rolled into the living room. What came into view was the worst thing that they witness since they gained consciousness at exactly 10 minutes ago. Various fruits were stacked up and lined up and covered with smoke coming from incense behind, mixed with the sob from the fruits.

'Get me out, please, eat me, throw me, anything...' The almost silent plea for help drowned the room with such grim that make all three of them deeply unnerved.

"Jesus What the hell is this." Orange said.

'I guess when your entire purpose of living is taken away from you, rendered you as a human made up [symbol] for them to satisfy their made up belief, that's what you are going to end up as, a purposeless manequine, waiting for the end that will never come.' Apple said.

After some uncomfortable minutes, Banana finally replied with nervous laughter, 'God chill applestottle mate, we are not going to turn out like them, don't worry.' Seeing them not wanting to make any move, Banana signal for them to leave.

"Do your really think there's no way to help them?" Orange asked dispiritedly. Gloomy mood has dominated the larger part of their journey to the unknown.
