"No". Meliz expressed with a face of unshakable determination. The limping 100
years old lady stared at Meliz with pure disbelieve. 

"Surely you can spare a few minutes to help an old lady cross the road, won't you. Well you see, my
hands are full of stuff for the old man back in my house and it's hard for
me to cross the road. " The old lady exclaimed with utmost sincerity, hoping
that the girl will change her mind.

"No, I'm sorry. You'll have to find another person." Meliz replied with a
nonchalant expression, in stark contrast with the old lady which expression
had quickly turned from everybody's grandmother who always cooks for you to the
grandmother from the shopping center fighting for the discounted cabbage.

"Tsk! Young people nowadays can't even show some simple empathies to the old
folks, you know back when..." Meliz turned away swiftly without letting the
old lady complete her rants. She had been extra conscious of her
surroundings, where she can feel 100 eyes staring at her like a social outcast.

She didn't want this, she didn't want all this. Every rejection she made is a scar
carved deep in her heart. Every night she replayed in her dream what will
happen if she said yes. Tonight, she'll picture herself grabbing the old lady's
hand, crossing the road, her eyes will meet the old lady warm and gentle eyes,
conveying the message of pure gratitude. As she is enjoying the moment of
tenderness, the old lady's face will start to disintegrate, everything around
her will start to melt, as her perfect world will start to collapse and ends
with her eyes starring at the ceiling with the alarm clock chirping endlessly.

She didn't choose to be a rejectionist. Ever since she was a kid she had been
taught to reject people, because that's the only way she can survive.
She had been a descendant of the Rejectionist-Family, who feeds on the despair
and misery of people being rejected, just like vampires feeds on blood.

"You look sad rejecting the poor old lady." She startled and turned to look at the source of
voice and found the man that had been bothering her lately.

After some moment of hesitation, she replied, "You wouldn't understand."

"I don't know, maybe I could if you are willing to tell me."

"No. Please leave me alone." That's all she said before she turned around and walk away, leaving the
man hanging. 

"You can't keep doing this you know" The man speaks out behind her as she
slowly walked away. He squinches and he displays a face full of unsettledness.

"I'm home!" Meliz announcement met with a dead silence, which is unusual. 

"Hello anybody home? I'm home!" Again, silence loomed through. She sighed and put
down her stuff, making her way to look in their rooms. That's when she heard a
quiet and silence wept coming from her brother's room. She sprinted towards her
brother's room. And her heart sank when she had been greeted the sight of her
parents clutching her brother's hands, tears running down their face.

"What? What happened to him? Dad? Mom?" She kneels and feels her brother's
soft face.

"He... Your brother... is getting rejected again. He had been experienced
extreme malnutrition, especially when it's 3 rejections in a row. Oh, he knows being
rejected is very harmful to us Rejectionist. Oh, my poor boy. " Her mother wept even more. 
After some resisting Meliz finally broke down and clutch her brother's arms,
feeling his weak pulse.

"Please Meliz, I beg you, don't repeat the same mistakes of your brother's. "
Her mom's intense plead touches her. She slowly nods her head, with a burning
will not break her heart anymore. The man's word echoed in her head again. 
"You can't keep doing this."

Later that week she met him again, in a train filled with people. "Do you want
to go and watch "cats" with me?" He asked in a rather cheerful way.

She managed to maintain her composure and replied with a firm answer. "No. Thousand times no."

"Ouch! That hurts. Are you sure about that? " 

She didn't reply, but noticed something off about the man, as his reply
getting weaker and weaker.

"You... you, all right? You didn't sound right."

"No, no, I'm all right. But I'm really happy that you noticed, and I wish
I looked worse right now."

She shot him a look of disgust and walked away determinedly. When she's out
of sight, his breath quickened as he steadied himself with the help of someone arms around. He quickly apologized and tottered away.

He grabbed the handrail, in an attempt to catch up with her. He can feel with
each step, ten thousand needles lining up on the floor, drilling his feet
with such intensity that he almost lost his conscience, but he kept moving.

She turned around and met his gaze, he looked anguish, but he kept his eyes
unmovingly at her. He opened his mouth, muttering something inaudibly and his
legs failed him and fell. She ran towards him, kneeled beside him and
suddenly felt an intense sense of dÃ©ja Vu.

"You... You are a... Why are you keep doing this when you know you can't afford
it?"

"I knew you were having a hard time rejecting those poor folks, you were just
not that person you want to be. "

"But you... You'll die with all those..."

He cut her off with what's left of him. "Shhh, don't talk anymore, just answer
me this. 

> Can I ask you out for a dinner?"

"n-, well, we'll see... how... first..." 

This time, he never heard her response.
