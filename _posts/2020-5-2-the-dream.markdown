It was a bad dream. I wanted to escape out of this cruel place, where the flowers were black and miserable, and the cold air stung deep in your skin, corroding my entire body inch by inch. I could hear the growling of the enormous oak tree sitting in front of me, not welcoming me. But I couldn't run, I couldn't move, I could feel the root under my foot penetrating into my body, wrapping my bleeding heart tight, the indecipherable agony fixing me in place. 

There was a figure approached me slowly, gradually extending her arms,
caressing my face while whispering calming words. She gently leads me inside the almost deserted house, still holding my hands tightly.

"Can I go back to where I belong?" I asked her. She turned around, and I noticed the battered scars across her face, the submission to the brutal passage of time clearly written over her expression under the pale moonlight.

"It's not time yet." She said calmly.

"I don't want to be here. Every second, every moment, it's suffocating me. Please, I want to go back, my heart can't take it anymore"

She wiped away my tears lightly, still hanging on the little smile, she said to me, "Soon, my dear, soon."

I was brought to a dark room where there stood a wooden bed. She laid me down and stroked my hair gently to the side. It was too late to make a run, as I was sunk deep into the bed, millions of tons of weight pushed down my chest. The big clock at the center of the room ticking uneasily. "Oh, my dear..."

I was quickly roused up of my bad dreams when the train came to an abrupt stop, snapping me back to reality. The sweat was dancing around my body and drenched my white tee. 

"It's okay. It's just a bad dream." said a girl standing in front of me, one of her hand is clutching a water bottle, while the other is gripping the grab rail holding herself still from the inertia. I can vaguely make out of her features through my watery eyes. Time was hesitant to move, and the flowers sprang itself up uncontrollably around the train at the sight of her, it was pink and lovely. I found myself unable to avert my eyes at her.

The announcement was made upon the arrival of the station. "Come on. Follow me." She said while extending her hands at me. I grabbed her hands, and let her took me away, not bothered by the peculiarness of the situation. We traveled through the entire pavement just outside of the train railway, still holding hands. I adored the gentle steps that she made, the subtle fragrance from her black smooth hair. And I found myself wishing that the road will go on forever.

She turned her glance to me occasionally, causing my heart to skip a beat. "I feel, " she began, "really, really happy right now. You and me, walking down the endless path. Do you feel the same way too?"

I nodded at her, cannot contain my joy, I smiled at her. The sun shone brightly that day.

I was in the darkroom again, lying on the bed. The room was illuminated by the moonlight, reflected its beam inside the room, where it made clear that books, pictures, and papers were scattered around. I clearly felt the unknown presence lingering around the room, I can feel monsters swirling under the bed, the pounding of the wall, the dreadful yell across the room. My breath grew heavier, the root wrapped around my heart even tighter, squeezing the blood out. 

I rose sharply out of my bed, determined to escape out of the house. I shoved aside all the
things blocking my way, growing nervous and nervous as I made a run to the door that stood ajar. Smudged by the tears of fear, I stumbled upon a wooden figure on the floor and smashed myself unto the wall. The big clock lost its balance and fell down to the ground where it crashed. I was watching the broken clock ticks beside me, where I slowly slipped away out of consciousness...

"You are sweating again. What happened? Bad dreams again?" She asked me.

"Yeah, it's a... weird dream." The sight of her made me feel sudden relief. 

"You shouldn't be wasting your time sleeping in day time anyway. Should we go earlier for the movie?"

"What?" I replied, having no recollection for any of that.

"*The cats* movie. You just asked me and bought the tickets. Remember?" Her face showed a hint of concern.

"Ye... Yeah of course."

She pulled me up teasingly off of the bed. She seems to be in a good mood. I let her pull me up with her minuscule strength, enjoying the candid moment where she growls, struggling to pull me out of the bed. Amid everything, I saw the broken clock ticking at the center of the room. I froze at the spot, my eyes widen with disbelieve.

"Why... why is the broken clock there." I started to panic, her room doesn't seem right, something is misplaced. I frantically got up and glanced around.

"The clock just fell down the other day. Is everything okay?" She asked. I turned around and looked at her, my heart stopped. Her face started to melt, and the semblance of the old lady starting to show.

"There you are, my dear. Everything is going to be alright." The old lady muttered it beside my bed, dampen towel mopped away my sweat. I was lying on the bed again, in my dream.

"I want to go back, please, let me go back." I pleaded to her.

"Don't you see," she began, her words had a hint of sorrow. "This is where you always belong, here with me. This is, reality."

"No. This is just a really bad dre-."

She interrupted me suddenly, her eyes started to turn red. "Stop. Just stop. Please." She broke down in tears, clasping my hands tightly. I don't believe any of this. It cannot be true. 

"Don't worry my darling." She held up a cup of water, her hands were trembling. "You'll be much, much better after having this. I promise." Her words almost turned into whispering. A dazzle of moonlight hit her face, highlighting her utter desolation.

"Hey! I'm here!" The girl called out on the other side of the river.

I stared at her glittering face, the presence that painted all the lovely spots of my life, beckoning me over to join her. The ambiance was serene, with the birds chirping happily away, and where the petals were as dazzling as her.

> This time, I will be with her forever.
