It was a bad dream. I could still vividly remember the enormous oak tree sitting in the middle of a [?], where the unpleasant things happen.


[First O]
1. First dream, unpleasant things, clock nailed to a tree, tickling. Met a person, don't like her. Trying to run away, but stumble (rock?).
2. Wake up, relief, clock still ticking, smaller clock.
3. Went to railway station, saw her, she quickly averted her eyes, ..., touched shoulder, get attracted. (then reference a tree and a clock).

[Second O]
1. The same tree, met a guy, talk about the situation. He talked about things that I hate, keep talking, I freaked out, he slowly turned into a giant cat[?].
2. Woke up to the sound of her, Meliz. In a restaurant on our first date, asked me what happened. (some indication that I was doing very well).
3. Start to worry abt the dream, finding why, saw the clock, pondering...

[Third O]
1. It's the third time, met another middle age girl, she's nice, asking me for help about [?], ..., 
2. we talked about a lot of things, about meliz, then she say something not nice, angried and run away, saw a cat that is staring at me, felt it's stare.
3. Back to reality, staring at a cat, and the cat walk away. Meliz asked why, apparently we are shopping. Realized I really liked her, determined to solve the situation.
