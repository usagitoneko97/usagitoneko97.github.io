Is being autistic scary? When the boss was being ridiculous, I have my colleagues to complain to. When buying "The Cats" movie tickets for two tragically turned into me buying the most expensive popcorn and drinks holder of my life, I'll salvage my broken heart with beer, pizza, dear friends and night full of laughter. 

And I always thought, will he, the autistic boy that I met when I was young be able to cope with all the problems.

I met him on a bright afternoon at his house. His hands were clutching a paintbrush as I walked into the house, coloring an artbook, which can perfectly qualify as contemporary abstract art. He is being ignored, just like the glorious ceramic vase sitting beside him.

I still vividly remember the pathetic attempt on saying hello to him. It was, just as satirically described before, greeting to a ceramic vase.

> I hated him.

I hated him because he was different, his unconventional way of doing things, his presence.

"Mr. Silver! Dead! Ms. Chen killed Mr. Silver! " He shouted abruptly, startled everyone around. The boy was quickly dragged into the room by his father, and his mom quickly explained to us that Mr. Silver is the dog next door having a sunbathing while Ms. Chen was trimming the bushes. The shriek of the boy and the howl of his father can be occasionally heard.

As I thought to myself of the punishments he'll get, he ran out of the room suddenly, with a face full of tears. But he was not unhappy, he was smiling. It somehow was a tear of joy after witnessing the revived-Mr. Silver flung his tail. He caressed his fluffy body, the love expressed by him was an overwhelming, pure and wordless expression of love. After all, everybody has a heart that can be touched by something, maybe he too, deserved to feel love.

I didn't understand the boy, but I wanted to, and that will make a difference. Autism is not a disease and not a choice, they deserve a chance. Sometimes you might feel resentment or impatience towards them, take a step back and a deep breath, sail through the storms and you might even discover a rainbow town at the other end.
